							<p> <b><a href="https://famm.org">FAMM</a></b>: FAMM’s mission is to create a more fair and effective justice system that respects our American values of individual accountability and dignity while keeping our communities safe.By sharing the impact of unjust sentencing and prison policies on incarcerated individuals, their families, and their communities, FAMM has helped create urgency around the issue and made the problem feel real to the policymakers who have to be moved to make meaningful change. This two-pronged approach — public education and targeted advocacy — is core to FAMM’s success to date and will remain critical to its work as the organization expands its organizing efforts nationally.

							<p>Information is a powerful motivator. We found the below resources captivating and disheartening, but ultimately powerful. Let us know if there are any materials we've missed. </p>
							<h3>Documentaries</h3>
							<p> <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8">13th</a></b>: Combining archival footage with testimony from activists and scholars, director Ava DuVernay's examination of the U.S. prison system looks at how the country's history of racial inequality drives the high rate of incarceration in America (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8"> Netflix </a>). This documentary won BestDocumentary at the Emmys, the BAFTAs and the NAACP Image Awards. Available to stream on Netflix and YouTube.</p>
							<p> <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h64qugj_iDg">Strong Island</a></b>: When filmmaker Yance Ford investigates the 1992 murder of a young black man, it becomes an achingly personal journey since the victim, 24-year-old William Ford Jr., was the filmmaker's brother (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt05873150/"> IMDB </a>). Available to stream on Netflix.</p>
							<p> <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrB3rOcrJxg">O.J.: Made in America</a></b>: It is the defining cultural tale of modern America - a saga of race, celebrity, media, violence, and the criminal justice system. And two decades after its unforgettable climax, it continues to fascinate, polarize, and even, yes, develop new chapters. Now, the producers of ESPN's award-winning "30 for 30" have made it the subject of their first documentary-event and most ambitious project yet. From Peabody and Emmy-award winning director Ezra Edelman, it's "O.J.: Made in America" (<a href="http://www.espn.com/30for30/ojsimpsonmadeinamerica/">ESPN</a>). Available to stream on ESPN and Netflix.</p>

							<h3>Books</h3>
							<p><b><a href="https://newjimcrow.com/">The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander</a></b>: The New Jim Crow is a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status—denied the very rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights Movement.Alexander shows that, by targeting black men through the War on Drugs and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of colorblindness. (<a href="https://newjimcrow.com/about">The New Jim Crow</a>)</p>
							<p> <b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43541840-prisoners-of-politics">Prisoners of Politics: Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration by Rachel Elise Barkow </a></b>: The United States has the world’s highest rate of incarceration, a form of punishment that ruins lives and makes a return to prison more likely. As awful as that truth is for individuals and their families, its social consequences—recycling offenders through an overwhelmed criminal justice system, ever-mounting costs, unequal treatment before the law, and a growing class of permanently criminalized citizens—are even more devastating. With the authority of a prominent legal scholar and the practical insights gained through on-the-ground work on criminal justice reform, Rachel Barkow explains how dangerous it is to base criminal justice policy on the whims of the electorate, which puts judges, sheriffs, and politicians in office. Instead, she argues for an institutional shift toward data and expertise, following the model used to set food and workplace safety rules.(<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674919235">Harvard University Press</a>).</p>

							<h3> TED Talks</h3>
							<p> <b><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_steinberg_and_manoush_zomorodi_the_us_is_addicted_to_incarceration_here_s_how_to_break_the_cycle">The US is addicted to incarceration. Here's how to break the cycle</a></b>: Nearly half a million people in the US are in jail right now without being convicted of a crime, simply because they can't come up with the money to pay cash bail. To try and fix this system, public defender and activist Robin Steinberg asked a straightforward question: What if we paid bail for them? In conversation with TED Radio Hour host Manoush Zomorodi, Steinberg shares how her nonprofit The Bail Project -- which uses a revolving fund to post bail for those who can't afford it -- is scaling up their efforts across the country and rolling out a new community-based model to fight mass incarceration. (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_steinberg_and_manoush_zomorodi_the_us_is_addicted_to_incarceration_here_s_how_to_break_the_cycle">TED</a>).</p>
							<p> <b><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_steinberg_what_if_we_ended_the_injustice_of_bail">What if we ended the injustice of bail?</a></b>: On any given night, more than 450,000 people in the United States are locked up in jail simply because they don't have enough money to pay bail. The sums in question are often around $500: easy for some to pay, impossible for others. This has real human consequences -- people lose jobs, homes and lives, and it drives racial disparities in the legal system. Robin Steinberg has a bold idea to change this. In this powerful talk, she outlines the plan for The Bail Project -- an unprecedented national revolving bail fund to fight mass incarceration.
